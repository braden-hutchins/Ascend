Braden Hutchins - Slider vs Star climb ranking. US4. Engagement. 
  The problem we're trying to solve is that users will want to give feedback for climbs and we want to know if its better to have a 1-5 star ranking system, or a soft-hard scale.
  We will make 50% of users able to see the experiment since it is a minor design desision and want to get the most feedback from each group.
  We would change the ranking system of each climb between a star ranking and a hard soft slider. We can see how users respond to the changes. 

Joseph Imondi. Local Gyms - Map vs List. US3. Engagement.
Metrics: Gyms viewed, Gyms selected

Hypothesis: Map will reduce actions and increase ease of access by giving context; List will better gym detail and discoverability by making scanning simpler.

Problem & Impact: Users need a fast way to discover nearby gyms; we donâ€™t know whether a map or a list is easier for the user. This affects discovery and direction, which drives real world gym visits.

Experiment: Show to 50% of users; split that 50/50 between Map and List. Track: gyms viewed and gyms selected. See which way makes the users go to gyms more.

Variations: 
    Map -  Show the users a map of the local area with all the gyms available
    List - Show the users a list of all local gyms
